## About

This work develops a structural account of meaning grounded in irreversible time and commitment formation.

Meaning is neither an intrinsic property of entities nor a projection of subjective valuation. Instead, it is identified with **commitment-relative significance**: an entity has meaning if and only if it alters continuation conditions under the system’s active commitments.

Commitments are formalized as persistent reductions of admissible futures ($F_{t+} \subset F_t$) within a partially ordered constraint topology $(F, \subseteq)$. Prior to commitment, total optionality prevails and no entity acquires structural necessity or differential relevance. Commitment induces selective closure, generating asymmetries that render some entities enabling, others obstructive, and others irrelevant. Meaning emerges from this state-space contraction and differential constraint, not from inherent attributes or arbitrary projection.

Meaninglessness corresponds to a **commitment vacuum** ($C_t = \emptyset$), a structural condition of absence of active binding rather than a metaphysical or evaluative error.

The account is substrate-neutral and treats significance purely as a consequence of structural relations under irreversible time. It resolves the meaning problem by deriving significance from relations within the induced constraint topology, without reliance on intrinsic properties, subjective projection, or domain-specific assumptions.
